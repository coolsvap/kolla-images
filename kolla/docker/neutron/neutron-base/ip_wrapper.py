# This file exists because we want to create and delete any network
# namespaces from the host mount namespace. This allows the host to
# access all of the neutron network namespaces as well as all
# containers that bind mount /run/netns from the host.

# This is required for "thin" neutron containers to function properly. However,
# due to a missing feature/bug in Docker it is not possible to use this script
# at this time. Once Docker updates with this feature we will usre this again.
